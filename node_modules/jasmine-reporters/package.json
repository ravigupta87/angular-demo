  "readme": "# Jasmine Reporters\n\nJasmine Reporters is a collection of javascript jasmine.Reporter classes that can be used with\nthe [JasmineBDD testing framework](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/).\n\nIncluded reporters:\n\n* ConsoleReporter - Report test results to the browser console.\n* JUnitXmlReporter - Report test results to a file in JUnit XML Report format.\n* NUnitXmlReporter - Report test results to a file in NUnit XML Report format.\n* TapReporter - Test Anything Protocol, report tests results to console.\n* TeamcityReporter - Basic reporter that outputs spec results to for the Teamcity build system.\n* TerminalReporter - Logs to a terminal (including colors) with variable verbosity.\n\n## Usage\n\nExamples are included in the test directory that show how to use the reporters,\nas well a basic runner scripts for Rhino + envjs, and a basic runner for\n[PhantomJS](https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs). Either of these methods could\nbe used in a Continuous Integration project for running headless tests and\ngenerating JUnit XML output.\n\n### Rhino + EnvJS\n\nEverything needed to run the tests in Rhino + EnvJS is included in this\nrepository inside the `ext` directory, specifically Rhino 1.7r2 and envjs 1.2\nfor Rhino.\n\n### PhantomJS\n\nShould work in most versions of PhantomJS > 1.4.1\nI have used PhantomJS 1.4.1 through 1.9.6 on Mac OS X with no problems.\n\n### Node.js\n\nMost of these reporters also work in node.js by making use of the excellent\n[jasmine-node project](https://github.com/mhevery/jasmine-node).\n",
